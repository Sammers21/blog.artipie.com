Artipie is a new binary artifact management toolkit, which is
very similar to Nexus and Artifactory, but with a number of important
advantages. First, it's fully open source. Second, it provides
high-availaibility out of the box (you can scale it horizontally).
Third, it supports 10+ package managers, including Maven, NuGet,
Rubygems, PyPi, Npm, Rpm, Helm, and others.

and so on. If you have something to say, shoot us
